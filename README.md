# Earthquake Damage Prediction (ISYE 6740)
The aim of this project is to predict the earthquake damage during the 2015 Nepal Earthquakes. The dataset is prepared by the Government of Nepal and includes building data from Kathmandu. Several approaches are compared in the project to determine the best method to predict when there is an ordered relationship between the classes of the target variable. This project was prepared as part of the ISYE 6740 Computational Data Analysis course which I took in the Fall 2023 semester at Georgia Tech.
